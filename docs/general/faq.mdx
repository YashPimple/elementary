**Question:** Hi, i am trying to test my models with days_back 45 days, but it is not picking up this value, and defaults to 14 days even though i have declared it on the dbt_project.yml level. I am sure I am missing a step here.

**Answer:** I think there are actually 3 steps to solve that.
1.full refresh of the model 'data_monitoring_metrics' by running ``` dbt run --select data_monitoring_metrics --full-refresh```
2.running the elementary tests again
3.run the CLI with days back param: ```edr monitor report --days-back 45```
##

**Question:** Ah ok will try that. So the variable defined in dbt project yml will recalculate the anomalies from 45 days till date, but in order to show up on the CLI, i also need to add that --days_back 45 ?

**Answer:** exactly :)
I totally understand that we didn't document that well enough.
Will think of how to be more informative there!
